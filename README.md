# Credit Risk Classification Analysis Report

**Purpose**
The purpose of the analysis was to use historical lending data from a lending services company to build a machine-learning model that can identify the credit worthiness of borrowers.

**Data**
Lending data was imported from `lending_data.csv`, which contained fields like `loan_size`, `interest_rate`, `borrower_income`, `debt_to_income`, `num_of_accounts`, `derogatory_marks`, `total_debt`, and `loan_status`. Healthy loans were identified as `0` and high risk loans were identified as `1` in the `loan_status` column.
